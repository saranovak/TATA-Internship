## Introduction
This repository contains the files for the analysis of an online retail store's data using Tableau. The goal of this analysis is to provide valuable insights to the CEO and CMO of the business, enabling them to evaluate the current business performance and make informed decisions for strategic planning and expansion.

## Project Overview
The online retail store has been performing well, and the management wants to understand the major factors contributing to the revenue. They are interested in metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Additionally, the management wants to identify areas of strength and opportunities for growth.

## Task
The task involves answering specific questions from the CEO and CMO and creating visualizations using Tableau. The questions and visualizations are as follows:

### Questions for CEO:
1. Revenue Time Series Analysis

How does the revenue for the year 2011 vary on a monthly basis?
What are the seasonal trends observed in the revenue data for the year?
What factors might contribute to these seasonal trends?

2. Regional Demand Analysis

Which regions/countries have the highest demand for our products?
Are there any expansion opportunities in specific regions/countries?
How can we strategically target these high-demand regions to generate more business?

### Questions for CMO:

3. Revenue by Country Analysis

Which countries generate the highest revenue?
What is the quantity sold along with the revenue generated?
Exclude the United Kingdom from the analysis.

4. Top Customers by Revenue Analysis

Who are the top 10 customers generating the highest revenue?
How does the revenue vary among these customers?
How can we ensure the satisfaction of these high-revenue customers?
For each question, create the corresponding visualizations in Tableau to present the data and insights effectively. Save the visualizations in the required format (.twbx) and store them in the /visuals folder.
